# Meet-up Event Planner

## About the app:
The App is live at https://glowing-fire-6341.firebaseapp.com/

Technologies used

Backend: Node.js, firebase
Frontend: Sass, Angular
Task Runner: Gulp

Build Process:
1. on terminal run ```node app``` on root folder named meetupplanner.
2. that will serve public_html folder and it's content.

The reason I am using Node is because Angular Controller requires a server to be working in order to use ng-views directive.
